```

# The 'batchtools'-package and its usage in IDE+A
## What does the package do?
Let's say you have

* algorithms (a1,a2, ...,an)
* algorithm settings (s1, ...)

You want to test and compare them on some functions:

* functions (f1, ...)

The 'batchtools' package can do that in a nicely organised way and fully automatic.

You want to do it **automatically on a cluster**? Even better.

### Example 1

```{r echo=TRUE, results='hide', message=FALSE}
require(ideaBatch)

## Create an Experiment Registry with a Dir-Name and a Sub-Directory for each test.
reg <- ideaMakeRegistry("Seminar","Test1") 

## Add Objective Functions
addProblem("Rosen2D", of_smoofByName("Rosenbrock",2))
addProblem("Rastr2D", of_smoofByName("Rastrigin",2))
    
## Add Algorithms
addAlgorithm("optimDE", algorithm_SpotOptimByName("optimDE", c(-5,-5),c(5,5),
                                                  control = list(funEvals = 500)))
addAlgorithm("cmaesCMAES",algorithm_CMAES(c(-5,-5),c(5,5)))
    
## Build Experiments
addExperiments(prob.designs = list("Rosen2D" = data.frame(),
                                    "Rastr2D" = data.frame()),
               repls = 20)
```

### Show a summary - which Experiments are run?

```{R}
summarizeExperiments()
```

### Run your experiments

```{R}
reg
submitJobs()
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
